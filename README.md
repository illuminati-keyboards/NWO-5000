# NWO-5000
production files for the creation of the NWO-5000 Keyboard


NWO-5000

[teaser pic]

Hi, welcome to the new world order series by Illuminati Keyboards. I'm Simon, you may know me from such classics such as "idiot throws kei and dents his TGR Alice" and "Drunk angry man yells at ICs" ... also a couple of keyboard group buys.

I have a plan, to offer a series of keyboards, VERY heavily "inspired" by the Cherry g80 series. The first of the series will be the NWO-5000, a g80-5000 style keyboard in aluminum.

Before we go any further, I would like to explain the mechanics of all NWO series boards buys.

1. A prototype, or a series of prototypes will be made until everyone involved is happy with the final product.

2. An IC will be posted to gather late-stage feedback (because GH doesn't like it when you post a GB thread out of nowhere)

3. A group buy will go live, and ALL files for the keyboard will be open sourced on the GB START date.

4. GB participants will fill in a raffle form

5. The Illuminati team will choose winners based on top secret investigative vodoo methods

6. Winners will be given a private link to buy their keyboard

7. The group buy will ship fully, and we will move on to the next project in the NWO series.

------------

This means that everyone that wants a unit will have an oppurtunity to get one, either by joining the GB, or by machining their own (either alone or with some help)

All files related to the keyboard design and production will be shared including the following:

-The case step files (for machining directly)
-The project f3d files (to allow anyone to edit the design to their liking)
-A price breakdown at specific MOQs with one or two chosen CNC companies (to give you an idea of cost)

-The PCB (whatever software) design files (to allow for PCB changes if needed)
-A zip file of all pcb components needed
-PCB assembly / specs file (to share with a pcb maker)
-Price information including gerbers at the PCB maker we used for the GB

-files containing information for small parts (gaskets, feet, internal JST cables) and where to buy them

-files for optional extras (foam, wrist rests, additional parts) will be available in both producable (.dxp / .step) formats, as well as project formats for easy moditification


All of the shared files will be available for personal or commercial use under a licenceless licence. [LINK]

The one request on the part of illuminati keyboards is to not add illuminati branding of any sort on any self-produced units (you may add your own branding, just do not include the illuminati logo)

In the case where someone breaks this one simple rule, all project files will be taken down, all future open sourcing of projects will be cancelled, and the violator will be publically shamed on the github page where the files once were.

------------

Future planned NWO projects are as follows:

NWO-500 (this project)
then NWO-8400 in TKL style
then NWO-3700 numpad
then NWO-1800 as 1800
then NWO-6000 as 60%
then NWO-3000 as fullsize

All will follow the same model, and will be released fully open sourced on their respective GB start dates.

------------

Now that everyone's seats are moist, please feast your eyes on the NWO-5000. A g80-5000 inspired, pcb gasket mount adjustable-ergo keyboard.


Fully Open Sourced Design
X Degree Typing Angle
6063 Alu case construction
Single color ano available at GB (silver)
STS XXX Slider-Sled
No weight (but the slider acts as a weight)
Adjustable opening from 0 to 45 degrees

XXXX Daughterboard
VIAL standard PCB by Hadi - With ANSI and ISO support as stock options (left side pcb is standard for both formats, right side PCB is available in an ansi version and an ISO version)
Comes in a custom cut hard case for protection and portability

Units will follow standard illuminati-level QC, with all B stock units being destroyed on-site.


Target price ($750 USD)
Produced in Korea by GEONWORKS
Vendor will likely be sandkeys.me or geon.works as sole vendor

Full financials will be shared once all costs are set in stone, illuminati keyboards will be making zero margin on this keyboard (and other keyboards in the NWO series)

If you choose to opt for the open-source format instead of joining the group buy, you will have the option of donating directly to either the PCB designer (Hadi) or the Case designer (bababaul) on the github page once live.
